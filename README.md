## Randomized Visual Phrases for Object Search

Code for visual object search method described in the paper [Randomized Visual Phrases for Object Search](http://eeeweba.ntu.edu.sg/computervision/Research%20Papers/2012/Randomized%20Visual%20Phrases%20for%20Object%20Search.pdf), by Yuning Jiang, Jingjing Meng and Junsong Yuan (Nanyang Technological University).


## Prerequisites
1. The code is written in Python 2.7.12. Therefore you need to have Python 2 installed on your computer before you can run the code.
2. Classes and methods from OpenCV 2.12 are used in the code. OpenCV 2.12 can be downloaded from http://opencv.org/.


## Format

To compile and run _locateObj.py_ make sure the directory tree looks like the following:

```Markdown
- RVP/
    - model/
        - kmeans
        - stoplist
        - ...
    - images//
        - I_00061.jpg (must be 5 digits)
        - I_00062.jpg
    - locateObj.py
    - featureExtractor.py
    - ...
```
